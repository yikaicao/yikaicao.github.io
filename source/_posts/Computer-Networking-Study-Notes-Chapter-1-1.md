# Computer Networks and the Internet

## Chapter 1: introduction
> Chapter goal: get “feel”, “ big picture”, introduction to terminology

## Overview/roadmap:
* What is the Internet? What is a protocol?
* Network edge: hosts, access network, physical media
* Network core: packet/circuit switching, internet structure
* Performance: loss, delay, throughput
* Protocol layers, service models
* Security
* History

### What is the Internet?
* Billions of connected devices:
	* hosts = end systems
	* running network apps at Internet’s “edge”
* Packet switches: forward packets (chunks of data)
	* routers, switches
* Communication links
	* fiber, copper, radio, satellite
	* transmission rate: bandwidth
* Networks
	* collection of devices, routers, links: managed by an organization
* Internet: “network of networks”
	* Interconnected ISPs (Internet Service Providers)
* protools are everywhere
	* control sending, receiving of messages
	* e.g., HTTP (Web), streaming video, SKype, TCP, IP, WiFi, 4G, Ethernet
* Internet standards
	* RFC: Request for Comments
	* IETF: Internet Engineering Task Force
* Infrastructure that provides services to applications:
	* Web, streaming video, multimedia teleconferencing, email, games, e-commerce, social media, interconnected appliances, …
* provides programming interface to distributed applications:
	* “hooks” allowing sending/receiving apps to “connect” to, use Internet transport service
	* provides service options, analogous to postal service

### What is a protocol?
* Network protocols:
	* computers (devices) rather than humans
	* all communication activity in Internet governed by protocols
	* Protocols define the format, order of messages sent and received among network entities, and actions taken on message transmission, receipt
